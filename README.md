**LIST OF ACTIVITIES** 

**1- Multiple of 3 or 5**  
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples 
of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.  

**2- Smallest minimum multiple**  
 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.
